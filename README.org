#+TITLE:Daw-Ran Liou's Emacs Configuration
#+STARTUP: overview

This is an ongoing evolution of my original Emacs configuration files, inspired
by a bunch of resources I’ve found online.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:dawranliou/emacs.d.git
#+end_src

* Startup performance

The startup time is ~0.6 seconds on my machine.  The only tricks I use is to
increase the startup GC threshold and defer loading package loading.  Nothing
too fancy here.

* Configuration structure

- =early-init.el= - See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][The Early Init File]]
- =init.el= - The majority of the configuration

These are kept out of git's version control:

- =private.el= - The file is loaded after init.

* Keybindings

This section might be out-dated because I am constantly tweaking my
configurations.

** Emacs-style keybindings

There are some cases where I prefer emacs style keybindings.

** Mac (OSX) ergonomics keybindings

Not anymore!

This section used to be my keybindings bound with the super modifier key
(usually the command key ⌘).  Since I started using ArchLinu on my personal
laptop (a ThinkPad T460S), I've grown to be less dependent on those keybindings.
Lately I decided to use the command keys as the meta keys on my mac as well.
This forced me to swap/remove some of the OS default keybindings.  However, the
benefit of having the meta key in a more ergonomics position outweighs the
trouble.  I spent most of my time in Emacs anyways.

** Evil/modal/vim-style keybindings

Not anymore!

As a refugee from Vim, I started off from Spacemacs, Doom, =evil-mode=, and then
=modalka=.  As I got closer to vanilla Emacs, the less I want to deal with all
the hassles of coming in and out of the modes.  When I switched to =modalka=
from =evil-mode= for its simplicity, I found myself not really using the
=modalka-mode= at all.  I am as efficient as (if not more efficient than) I was
using modal editing.  So i think it's time for me to graduate from the modal
editing in general and embrace the Emacs key sequences.
