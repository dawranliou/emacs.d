#+TITLE:Daw-Ran Liou's Emacs Configuration
#+STARTUP: overview

This is an ongoing evolution of my original Emacs configuration files, inspired
by a bunch of resources Iâ€™ve found online.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone git@github.com:dawranliou/emacs.d.git
#+end_src

* Startup performance

The startup time is ~0.6 seconds on my machine.  The only tricks I use is to
increase the startup GC threshold and defer loading package loading.  Nothing
too fancy here.

* Configuration structure

- =early-init.el= - See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][The Early Init File]]
- =init.el= - The majority of the configuration

These are kept out of git's version control:

- =private.el= - The file is loaded after init.

* Keybindings
Keybinding ideas:

This section might be out-dated because I am constantly tweaking my
configurations.

** Mac (OSX) ergonomics keybindings

Several OSX native keybindings that utilizes the command key (which is also the
=super= key) are added to make context-switching to other native apps easier,
e.g. Chrome, Firefox.

| Key           | Binding                 |
|---------------+-------------------------|
| s-=           | text-scale-adjust       |
| s--           | text-scale-decrease     |
| s-<backspace> | kill-whole-line         |
| s-F           | rg-project              |
| s-S           | write-file              |
| s-a           | mark-whole-buffer       |
| s-g           | magit-status            |
| s-k           | kill-this-buffer        |
| s-p           | project-find-file       |
| s-q           | save-buffers-kill-emacs |
| s-s           | save-buffer             |
| s-t           | open scratch buffer     |
| s-v           | yank (paste)            |
| s-w           | delete-window           |

** Emacs-style keybindings

There are some cases where I prefer emacs style keybindings.

| Key     | Binding               |
|---------+-----------------------|
| C-;     | iedit-mode            |
| C-M-'   | +eshell-here          |
| C-M-j   | switch-to-buffer      |
| C-c C-d | helpful-at-point      |
| C-c g   | magit-file-dispatch   |
| C-c r   | rg                    |
| C-h B   | embark-bindings       |
| C-h C   | helpful-command       |
| C-h F   | describe-face         |
| C-x C-b | ibuffer               |
| C-x C-j | dired-jump            |
| C-x C-r | recentf-open-files+   |
| C-x C-z | selectrum-repeat      |
| C-x g   | magit-status          |
| M-/     | hippie-expand         |
| M-:     | pp-eval-expression    |
| M-i     | delete-other-windows  |
| M-j     | avy-goto-char-timer   |
| M-n     | scroll up 4 line      |
| M-o     | other-window          |
| M-p     | scroll down 4 line    |
| s-,     | xref-pop-marker-stack |
| s-.     | embark-act            |

** Evil/modal/vim-style keybindings

Not anymore!  As a refugee from Vim, I started off from Spacemacs, Doom,
=evil-mode=, and then =modalka=.  As I got closer to vanilla Emacs, the less I want
to deal with all the hassles of coming in and out of the modes.  When I switched
to =modalka= from =evil-mode= for its simplicity, I found myself not really using
the =modalka-mode= at all.  I am as efficient as (if not more efficient than) I
was using modal editing.  So i think it's time for me to graduate from the modal
editing in general and embrace the Emacs key sequences.
