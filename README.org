#+TITLE:Daw-Ran Liou's Emacs Configuration

This is an ongoing evolution of my original Emacs configuration files, inspired
by a bunch of resources I’ve found online:

* Startup performance

The startup time is ~0.5 seconds on my machine. I apply a couple of techniques
from Doom (see: [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/faq.org#how-does-doom-start-up-so-quickly][How does Doom start up so quickly?]]). I also set
=straight-check-for-modifications= to =(check-on-save find-when-checking)=
because I don't usually tweak my dependencies.

* Configuration structure

- =early-init.el= - See [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Early-Init-File.html][The Early Init File]]
- =init.el= - The majority of the configuration
- =lisp/extras.el= - Couple of things I found online. Credits to:
  - [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/wiki/Useful-Commands][selectrum's wiki]]

These are kept out of git's version control:

- =private.el= - The file is loaded after init.
- =custom.el= - The file is for the custom settings.
- =backups= - The folder is for backups.
- =auto-save-list= - The folder is for the auto save files.

* Mac (OSX) ergonomics keybindings

Several OSX native keybindings that utilizes the command key (which is also the
=super= key) are added to make context-switching to other native apps easier,
e.g. Chrome, Firefox.

| Key             | Binding                 |
|-----------------+-------------------------|
| =s-s=           | save-buffer             |
| =s-S=           | write-file              |
| =s-q=           | save-buffers-kill-emacs |
| =s-a=           | mark-whole-buffer       |
| =s-k=           | kill-this-buffer        |
| =s-v=           | yank                    |
| =s-c=           | kill-ring-save          |
| =s-z=           | undo                    |
| =s-==           | text-scale-adjust       |
| =s--=           | text-scale-decrease     |
| =s-<backspace>= | kill-whole-line         |
| =s-w=           | evil-window-delete      |
| =s-t=           | open scratch buffer     |
| =s-f=           | ctrlf-forward-fuzzy     |
| =s-F=           | rg-project              |
| =s-p=           | project-find-file       |
| =s-g=           | magit-status            |
| =s-l=           | lsp-keymap              |
| =s-/=           | commenting line         |
| =s-'=           | er/expand-region        |
| =s-\=           | er/contract-region      |

* Evil (Vim-style) keybindings

I used to use Spacemacs and then Doom Emacs and I like the idea of using =SPC=
as the prefix. What I dislike about it is that many keybindings are too many
keystrokes away. So I try to be conservative about what I added to the
=SPC=-prefixed keymap.

A good read about evil keybindings (and emacs keymaps in general):

| Key       | Binding                               |

| =SPC t w= | whitespace-mode                       |
| =SPC t m= | toggle-frame-maximized                |
| =SPC t M= | toggle-frame-fullscreen               |

| =SPC R=   | elfeed                                |

* Emacs-style keybindings

There are some cases where I prefer emacs style keybindings.

| Key        | Binding               |
|------------+-----------------------|
| =<escape>= | keyboard-escape-quit  |
| =C-M-u=    | universal argument    |
| =C-e=      | end-of-line           |
| =C-y=      | yank                  |
| =C-k=      | kill-line             |
| =M-.=      | xref-find-definition  |
| =M-,=      | xref-pop-marker-stack |
| =C-x C-b=  | ibuffer               |
| =C-M-j=    | switch-to-buffer      |
| =M-:=      | pp-eval-expression    |
| =M-/=      | hippie-expand         |
| =M-o=      | ace-window            |
| =C-M-,=    | embark-act            |
| =C-h B=    | embark-bindings       |
| =C-c C-d=  | helpful-at-point      |
| =C-h C=    | helpful-command       |
| =C-h F=    | describe-face         |
| =C-x C-j=  | dired-jump            |
| =C-M-'=    | eshell-toggle         |
| =C-x g=    | magit-status          |
| =C-c g=    | magit-file-dispatch   |
| =M-y=      | yank-pop+             |
| =C-x C-r=  | recentf-open-files+   |
| =C-M-r=    | selectrum-repeat      |
