# Standard themes for GNU Emacs

The `standard-themes` are a collection of light and dark themes for
GNU Emacs. The `standard-light` and `standard-dark` emulate the
out-of-the-box looks of Emacs (which technically do NOT constitute a
theme) while bringing to them thematic consistency, customizability,
and extensibility. Other themes are stylistic variations of those.

Why call them "standard"? Obviously because: Standard Themes Are Not
Derivatives but the Affectionately Reimagined Default ... themes.
