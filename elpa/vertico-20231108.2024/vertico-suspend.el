;;; Commentary:

;; This package is a Vertico extension, which provides the
;; `vertico-suspend' command to suspend the current Vertico completion
;; session.  If `vertico-suspend' is called from within the currently
;; active Vertico completion minibuffer, the completion session is
;; suspended.  Otherwise the last session is restored.  It is possible
;; to suspend multiple nested Vertico sessions.  Note that
;; `vertico-suspend' requires you to enable recursive minibuffers, see
;; the variable `enable-recursive-minibuffers'.
;;
;; (keymap-global-set "M-S" #'vertico-suspend)
;;
;; See also the related extension `vertico-repeat', which uses a
;; different technique, storing a completion session history.
;;
;; The extension has the following known issues:
;;
;; * `vertico-suspend' restores the window configuration when resuming
;;   and when `vertico-buffer' is used.  This can be seen as a
;;   disturbance, however minibuffer exiting also changes the window
;;   configuration by default.
;;
;; * `echo-keystrokes' does not work in recursive minibuffers.  This
;;   issue cannot be fixed without modifying the C source of Emacs,
;;   since Emacs disables echo in recursive minibuffers.
