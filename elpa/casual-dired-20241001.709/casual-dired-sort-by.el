;;; Commentary:

;; casual-dired-sort-by is a set of functions that provide richer sorting
;; capability to Dired mode. Two means are provided:
;;
;; - Transient menu for a keyboard-driven workflow
;; - Context menu for a mouse-driven workflow
;;
;; * Installation
;;
;; To use the Transient menu, ensure that you have these statements in your
;; init file.
;;
;; (require 'casual-dired-sort-by)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "s") 'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu)
;;
;; The keymap `casual-dired-sort-menu' can be used in a context menu
;; (see `context-menu-mode') or some other main menu.
;;
;; Typically this is done with code looking like this:

;; (defun casual-dired-context-menu-addons (menu click)
;;   "Customize context MENU with CLICK event."
;;   (easy-menu-add-item menu nil casual-dired-sort-menu)
;;   menu)
;; (add-hook 'context-menu-functions #'casual-dired-context-menu-addons)
