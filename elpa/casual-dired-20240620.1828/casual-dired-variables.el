  "List of GNU ‘ls’ arguments used to initialize the “Sort By” menu.

This variable is used to initialize the prefix arguments in the
Transient menu `casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu', provided that there
are no saved prefix values via `transient-save'.  In the event of
the latter, then the saved values are used to populate the menu
and this variable is ignored.  Note that this is a global value
and can not be configured per Dired buffer.

Note that this variable is only observed by the “Sort By”
menu (`casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu').

This variable is designed to not be dependent on
`dired-ls-sorting-switches'. Configure
`dired-ls-sorting-switches' to define the initial sorting of a
Dired buffer upon its creation.

Runtime changes to this variable will not take effect until the
next restart of Emacs.

The switch \"-l\" should not be used as it is automatically
accounted for.

This variable requires GNU ‘ls’ from coreutils installed.

See the man page `ls(1)' for details."
