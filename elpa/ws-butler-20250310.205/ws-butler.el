;; Ver 1.3 2025/03/10 Sean Whitton
;;     Replace a use of `always' to retain compatibility with older Emacs.
;;     Thanks to Chris Rayner for the reporting the problem.
;;
;; Ver 1.2 2025/02/25 Sean Whitton
;;     When `special-mode' is in `ws-butler-global-exempt-modes', also check
;;     whether a mode has a `mode-class' of `special', and don't activate
;;     `ws-butler-mode' if it does.
;;     Remove entries from `ws-butler-global-exempt-modes' that the preceding
;;     changes renders redundant.
;;     Exempt `org-agenda-mode' from `ws-butler-global-mode' by default.

;;
;; Ver 1.0 2025/02/18 Sean Whitton
;;     Take over maintenance; maintain out of nongnu-elpa.git.
;;     Bump to version 1.0: core functionality not expected to change.
