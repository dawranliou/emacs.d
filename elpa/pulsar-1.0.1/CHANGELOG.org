* Version 1.0.0 on 2023-08-12
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0d09da86-29be-461e-8ef6-1e93a07b756b
:END:

- The ~next-buffer~ and ~previous-buffer~ commands are added to the
  default value of the user option ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.  They
  will now trigger a pulse effect after they are called (if
  ~pulsar-mode~ is enabled in the current buffer or
  ~pulsar-global-mode~ is in use).

- The command ~pulsar-recenter-middle~ is now an alias for
  ~pulsar-recenter-center~, instead of being the original name.  Users
  do not need to change anything on their end: this is just an
  internal arrangement to use a name that corresponds to the one of
  the underlying "recenter" mechanism.

- The Lisp macro that was used to derive the Pulsar "recenter"
  commands has been removed.  The commands are ~pulsar-recenter-top~
  and ~pulsar-recenter-center~.  I originally thought the macro would
  be useful in more places, but I ended up relying on it only twice.

  Thanks to Ryan Kaskel for pointing out an intermediate typo/error I
  made while redefining the macro and before I decided to remove it
  altogether.  This was done as a comment on the GitHub mirror:
  <https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/commit/c5086de779a0226d72eca4d5cba8c7689bc278b2#r123397272>.

- The Lisp macro ~pulsar-pulse-with-face~ is renamed to
  ~pulsar-define-pulse-with-face~.  Its definition is updated to
  simplify how a Pulsar function is defined with a given face.
  Examples of such functions are ~pulsar-pulse-line-red~,
  ~pulsar-pulse-line-blue~.

- Pulsar now retrieves the absolute beginning of the minibuffer
  prompt.  This means that a pulse in the minibuffer will cover the
  text of the prompt, as opposed to only affecting the input area.  As
  such, the pulse is visible even if the minibuffer is empty
  (e.g. what happens with the default completion setup when calling
  =M-x=).

- The manual provides instructions on how to set up Pulsar to produce
  a pulse when the minibuffer is activated.  It cannot be done with
  the ~pulsar-pulse-functions~, though the setup is not too involved.
  In short:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)

  ;; OR something like this, replacing "blue" with one among red,
  ;; green, yellow, magenta, cyan:
  (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line-blue)
  #+end_src

* Version 0.5.0 on 2022-08-19
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:20bf677d-bcef-4606-8cc2-ebd49bfc057b
:END:

+ Added convenience functions/commands to pulse a line using one of the
  provided faces.  These can be used interactively or via Lisp (e.g. be
  assigned to a hook).  They are:

  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-red~
  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-green~
  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-yellow~
  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-blue~
  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-magenta~
  - ~pulsar-pulse-line-cyan~

+ Deprecated ~pulsar-pulse-on-window-change~ due to complications it
  created in some edge cases.  Part of this effort was to fix a bug that
  pertained to a duplicate pulse when the pulsar commands were invoked
  via =M-x=.  The duplication had the effect of potentially overriding
  the color of the pulse such as if, say, ~pulsar-pulse-line-red~ was
  invoked while the ~pulsar-face~ was blue.

+ Restored several command symbols to the default value of
  ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.  Those were disabled to support the use
  option ~pulsar-pulse-on-window-change~, but as that is now removed we
  revert to the old and more predictable way of handling things.

+ Introduced conditionality that checks for ~real-this-command~.  This
  is necessary for commands that have to fudge ~this-command~ to provide
  their functionality.  Such is the case with the ~evil-scroll-up~ and
  ~evil-scroll-down~ commands which are internally reported as
  ~previous-line~ and ~next-line~, respectively.  I discovered this
  problem while trying to support Duy Nguyen attempts that making
  =pulsar= work with =evil=.

  Thanks to Duy Nguyen for reporting the issue on the mailing list and
  then to Tom Dalziel who explained why =evil= does things the way it
  does (it is a good reason):

  - <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar/%3C89566F5C-25AD-4281-94CB-031FE8878119%40gmail.com%3E>
  - <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar/%3C87pmgy3vzq.fsf%40protesilaos.com%3E>
  - <https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/1659>

+ Documented how to use pulsar with the =next-error-hook=.  By default,
  the =n= and =p= keys in Emacs' compilation buffers (e.g. the results
  of a ~grep~ search) produce a highlight for the locus of the given
  match.  Due to how the code is implemented, we cannot use Pulsar's
  standard mechanism to trigger a pulse after the match is highlighted
  (i.e. by adding the commands to ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.  Instead,
  the user must add this to their configuration:

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'next-error-hook #'pulsar-pulse-line)
  #+end_src

+ Made other miscellaneous changes to tweak the code base and the
  manual.

* Version 0.4.0 on 2022-07-19
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:762631cc-f60c-42b1-977b-00fd71c1a37e
:END:

+ Added the user option ~pulsar-pulse-on-window-change~.  This covers
  all commands or functions that affect the current window, so there is
  no need to include them individually in the ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.
  Users who prefer to trigger a pulse only after select functions
  (e.g. only after ~other-window~) are advised to set this user option
  to nil and update the ~pulsar-pulse-functions~ accordingly.  Thanks to
  Ivan Popovych for the patch (commit =b1a78dd=).

+ Changed the default value of ~pulsar-pulse-functions~ to omit all
  those commands which are already covered by the aforementioned.  In
  the interest of continuity, the old value is kept in the source code,
  with the relevant symbols commented out.

+ Named the mailing list email address as the =Maintainer:= of Pulsar.
  The package headers help the user find our primary sources and/or
  communication channels.  This change conforms with work being done
  upstream in package.el by Philip Kaludercic.  I was informed about it
  here:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/general-issues/%3C875ykl84yi.fsf%40posteo.net%3E>.

+ Updated the documentation, where necessary and made other minor tweaks
  to the code.

* Version 0.3.0 on 2022-04-08
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:e0cd59e1-7a0b-47b5-b9fe-a20e1fa196f0
:END:

+ Changed the source repository from GitLab to SourceHut:
  <https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar>.  Use the mailing list to
  start a discussion, report a bug, send a patch, etc.:
  <https://lists.sr.ht/~protesilaos/pulsar>.  The GitLab URL will serve
  as a mirror from now on (a GitHub mirror is still available and will
  remain that way).

+ Refined how Pulsar behaves in the case of the last line.  Basically,
  when the last line cannot be highlighted we want to pulse the one
  right above.  Thanks to JD Smith for fine-tuning this behaviour in
  merge request 1 over at the GitLab mirror:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/1> (exempt
  from the requirement to assign copyright to the Free Software
  Foundation as it is below the threshold).

+ Ensured that the Pulsar effect are limited to the current window when
  the buffer is displayed in multiple windows.  This avoids the common
  problem of simultaneous highlights in multiple locations, which
  confuse rather than inform the user of where the point is.  Thanks to
  Aymeric Agon-Rambosson for the contribution in merge request 2 over at
  the GitLab mirror:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/merge_requests/2>.  Aymeric
  has assigned copyright to the Free Software Foundation.

+ Wrote a buffer-local and a global minor mode that sets up Pulsar.
  This supersedes the old design which had a built-in assumption that
  the "pulse line" effect should always be global.  Now the user has
  more flexibility.  They may also disable Pulsar on demand.  Note that
  pulsar still only triggers its effect for entries in the user option
  ~pulsar-pulse-functions~.  Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback
  in issue 9 over at the GitLab mirror:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/9>.

+ Implement the ~pulsar-highlight-dwim~ command.  It is like the
  ~pulsar-highlight-line~ except it also understands regions, be they
  regular or rectangular.  Thanks to Mark Barton for the feedback in
  issue 13 over at the GitLab mirror:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/13>.

+ Clarified some technical points in various doc strings and the manual,
  such as what is the ~pulsar-delay~ and the ~pulsar-iterations~.
  Thanks to Rudolf Adamkovič for the feedback in issue 12 over at the
  GitLab mirror: <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/12>.

* Version 0.2.0 on 2022-03-16
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:27d0bdb0-7099-41f3-8a08-b2e3d01aa36c
:END:

+ Fixed an inconsistency that was present when Emacs was running in a
  server-client model where the highlight would never pulse but instead
  remain fixed in place until another command was invoked.  By default,
  the pulse effect should now work for that use-case.  Thanks to Mark
  Barton, Petter Storvik, and user kb for their feedback in issue 1:
  <https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/pulsar/-/issues/1>.

+ Implemented the ~pulsar-highlight-line~ command and abstracted the
  relevant code.  Unlike ~pulsar-pulse-line~, it never pulses the
  current line.  Instead it keeps the highlight in place until another
  command is invoked.  Thanks to Mark Barton for proposing this in
  issue 1.

+ Introduced the user option ~pulsar-pulse~ which determines whether
  pulsar should use a pulse effect (notwithstanding the aforementioned
  new command).  When its value is non-nil (the default) pulsing takes
  place.  Thanks to Petter Storvik for suggesting this approach in
  issue 1.

+ Added the user option ~pulsar-iterations~ which controls how smooth or
  abrupt the pulse effect is.  This complements the existing variable
  ~pulsar-delay~.  Both apply only when ~pulsar-pulse~ is non-nil.

+ Wrote the ~pulsar-generic~ face and made it the default value of the
  ~pulsar-face~ user option.  This is consistent with the original
  design of a theme-agnostic presentation, though now it ensures that
  the =:extend= attribute is used to stretch the highlight to the edge
  of the window (without it and depending on the theme, the highlight
  would only reach the last character on the line).

+ Updated the manual to reflect those changes.

Initial release of the package.  Please read the manual.

The core idea for this package was implemented in the =prot-pulse.el=
file that is part of [[https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles][my dotfiles]] (now deprecated).  I was using it at
least since December 2020.
